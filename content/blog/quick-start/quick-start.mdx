## Getting Started With Greenlight

Greenlight is a starter template for deploying a very fast and slick website for posting Data Visualizations built with Tableau.
Use Greenlight to setup a data portal at your company or use it to build a personal data blog. This application is designed to be fast and easy to deploy, without relying on servers - thus freeing you from having to maintain them!

The starter accomplishes this by using Gatsby as the framework. However you don’t
need to be an expert on Gatsby or React to use this starter but if you would like
to learn more you can find info on Gatsby [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

You can write posts with Markdown (`.md`). Posts that will embed Tableau data visualizations will use MDX (`.mdx`) files. 
MDX files are Markdown files that also support **JSX** (a JavaScript syntax extension used by [React](https://reactjs.org/)). This means that you can extend Markdown with **JSX components** that we have made available for you to use.
You don’t need to be an expert on MDX either, you can learn more about it [here](https://mdxjs.com/).

<br />

## First Steps

1. If you don't already have the Gatsby CLI installed then you can do so by using this command to install it globally to your machine.

   ```bash
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. Next you will install the Greenlight Gatsby Starter.

   ```bash
   gatsby new {your-project-name} https://github.com/API-Guild/greenlight
   ```

3. Then start the site in `develop` mode.

   - First `cd your-project-name`.
   - Then run `gatsby develop` in the command line.

4. Open your site in the browser at `http://localhost:8000`
   <br />

## Lets break it down further.

When you open `http://localhost:8000` you will see this sample site. Take a minute to navigate around and get a feel for the site. This is your template that you can change as little or as much as you would like to. If you just want to move on to posting a blog post or some data visualizations we’ll go over those steps now.

### Making a post

1. There are many files and folders in the directory but to make a post you only need to use the `/content/blog` directory.
   <br />
2. Once you have navigated to the `/content/blog` directory make a new folder called `my-first-post`
   <br />
3. Inside that folder you can make a file that will be your post. You can use either Markdown or MDX files but for this example we will use MDX. _Please note that Greenlight is setup only to render Markdown and MDX files from this directory so you must put your files here for them to render properly._
   <br />
4. Inside your `my-first-post` folder make a file called `my-first-post.mdx`.
   <br />
5. Inside this file you first need to add your title, description and date of the post in the format below.

```yaml

---
```

6. For the most part you can write your post using normal Markdown syntax as you would any normal blog post. Where MDX comes into play is bringing in your data visualizations. For this example we are using our Tableau component which comes with Greenlight.

```javascript
<Tableau
  viz="https://public.tableau.com/views/Greenlight/GreenlightProfitDashboard"
  options={{
    width: 1000,
    height: 800
  }}
/>
```

Using the `viz={your-url}` you can plug in your own URL's.

#### When it renders it will look like this.

<Tableau
  viz="https://public.tableau.com/views/Greenlight/GreenlightProfitDashboard"
  options={{
    width: 1000,
    height: 800,
  }}
/>

## Conclusion

I hope this quick start guide is able to help you see the ease of which you can have a very fast website to host your data up and running in no time.
