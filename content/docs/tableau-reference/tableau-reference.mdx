<ExtLink to="https://www.tableau.com/" color="has-text-tableau">Tableau</ExtLink> is likely the most customizable platform 
for building data visualizations that does not require programming (except for calculations). Content is created by connecting 
Tableau Desktop to databases or files containing data. This content is then hosted on a Tableau Server.

<br/>
<br/>

As a result embeddeable 
content can be highly varied and creative. The platform truly shines when users with valuable domain knowledge are
empowered to build complex and interactive visualizations that would otherwise be beyond their reach if it required 
experience with visualization packages for languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/),
or [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).


As a result, [Greenlight](https://api-guild.github.io/greenlight) seeks to make the embedding process as 
straightforward as possible. Although important implementation details such as sizing and layouts can be 
addressed by the <ExtLink to="https://www.tableau.com/" color="has-text-tableau">Tableau</ExtLink> developer, this component aims to solve 
those issues out of the box. Users are always welcome to modify their 
workbooks to fit an embedded usecase, however we wouldn't want a potential disconnect between dashboard and site developers 
to slowdown the delivery of content.

In other words, you should be able to _**plug and go**_.

The first example demonstrates the component's default behavior. 
The only `prop` that is required is either a single URL (string) or multiple URLs in the form of an array. 
To clarify, the following are examples of string and arrays in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/):

```js
// this is a string
singleURL = "https://{YOUR-VIZ-URL}";

// this is an array
arrayOfURLs = [
  "https://{YOUR-VIZ-URL-#1}",
  "https://{YOUR-VIZ-URL-#2}",
  "https://{YOUR-VIZ-URL-#3}",
];
```
<br/>

## Basic Usage

Notice that this example only declares an array of URLs. By default the buttons available on the toolbar
are styled using the primary colors of your website's theme. They are also rounded and outlined. You can learn more at 
[Bulma's documentation for buttons](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/button/). By default, all buttons and capabilities
provided by the toolbar are made available.

```js {numberLines}
<Tableau
  viz={[
    "https://public.tableau.com/views/Greenlight/GreenlightProfitDashboard",
    "https://public.tableau.com/views/Greenlight/SummaryofProfitAnalysisrange",
    "https://public.tableau.com/views/Greenlight/WeeklyMetrics",
  ]}
/>
```

<Tableau
  viz={[
    "https://public.tableau.com/views/Greenlight/GreenlightProfitDashboard",
    "https://public.tableau.com/views/Greenlight/SummaryofProfitAnalysisrange",
    "https://public.tableau.com/views/Greenlight/WeeklyMetrics",
  ]}
/>

The toolbar can be removed entirely by setting this prop to false in the component:

```js
customToolbar={false}
```
<br/>

### Props
Here is a list of `props` that can customize the <ExtLink to="https://www.tableau.com/" color="has-text-tableau">Tableau</ExtLink> component:

| Prop           | Type                                                                                                | Description                                                                            | Values                                                                                           |
| :---           | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| viz            | <span className="has-text-success">string</span> or <span className="has-text-warning">array</span> | obtained from the share link on a viz                                                  | URL                                                                                              |
| customToolbar  | <span className="has-text-undraw">boolean</span>                                                    | controls toolbar visibility, default is <span className="has-text-success">true</span> | <span className="has-text-success">true</span> or <span className="has-text-danger">false</span> |
| toolbarOptions | <span className="has-text-info">object</span>                                                       | object for customizing the toolbar                                                     | described below                                                                                  |

#### toolbarOptions

The toolbarOptions `prop` is the most complex, however every option has safe defaults in case you miss declaring any of them.

| Option    | Type                                             | Description                                                                                 | Values                                                                                           |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| buttons   | <span className="has-text-warning">array</span>  | lists buttons added to the toolbar, default shows all of them. Empty arrays removes them    | undo, redo, reset, refresh, details, share                                                       |
| color     | <span className="has-text-success">string</span> | sets the color scheme for buttons, default uses the primary site color                      | primary, warning, info, success, danger, link                                                    |
| outline   | <span className="has-text-undraw">boolean</span> | sets the type of button, default is <span className="has-text-success">true</span>          | <span className="has-text-success">true</span> or <span className="has-text-danger">false</span> |
| rounded   | <span className="has-text-undraw">boolean</span> | sets the border type for buttons, default is <span className="has-text-success">true</span> | <span className="has-text-success">true</span> or <span className="has-text-danger">false</span> |
| downloads | <span className="has-text-warning">array</span>  | lists download options, default shows all of them. Empty arrays removes them                | pdf, image, data, crosstab, powerpoint, workbook                                                 |
